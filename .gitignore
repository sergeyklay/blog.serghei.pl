# It is, in short, a resource cache. In many cases you will not
# need to keep generated files, except two cases:
#
# 1. If you are theme author, you will most likely want to put
#    the generated/fingerprinted resources as part of the theme
#    distribution, so the users does not need to have PostCSS etc.
#    installed to run your theme.
#
# 2. If you use lots of thumbnails, you may consider comitting
#    this to GitHub to avoid having to create thumbnails on every
#    CI build etc.
#
# Both of these cases are not my case, so I ignore this directory.
