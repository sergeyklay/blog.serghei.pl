# Cactus 2 - A Modern Take on the Cactus Theme for Hugo

## Overview

This project is a complete reimplementation of the
[Cactus Theme](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus), initially
created by [monkeyWzr](https://github.com/monkeyWzr) for Hugo. The original
theme has not been actively maintained for over five years, with issues
unresolved and pull requests ignored. Given the lack of updates and the
evolving needs of modern web development, I have decided to rebuild this
theme from scratch while preserving its core design ethos.

This version introduces significant improvements in terms of performance,
maintainability, and new features, all while maintaining the aesthetic and
structure that made the original theme popular.

## Original Author

All credit for the original design and inspiration goes to
[monkeyWzr](https://github.com/monkeyWzr). This project is not affiliated with
them and should be considered an independent evolution of their work.

## Changes from the Original Theme

For details on the changes from the original theme, please refer to the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
